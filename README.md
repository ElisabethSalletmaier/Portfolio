SNAKE GAME:
consists of 2 files: snake_main.py, snake_class.py, data.txt
The classes are imported in the main file. The text file is used to save the highest score.


How it works: 

Run the code of snake_main.py and a window appears with the game "snake" for 1 player.
The player navigates with the 4 arrow buttons: up, down, right, left

The game involves controlling a snakehead by turning in 4 possible directions by ninety degrees until you manage to eat the blue turtle. 
When you get the turtle, you get 1 point, the snake grows an extra body segment and a new blue turtle is visible on the screen. 
If, or rather when, the snake bumps into the edge of the screen or accidentally eats itself the game is over and starts automatically again. 
At the scoreboard you can see your current score as well as the highest reached score so far.
