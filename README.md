PONG GAME:
consists of 2 files: main.py and classes.py
The classes of classes.py are imported into the main.py
python 3.10


How it works:

Pong is a "tennis like" game that features two paddles and a ball. 
Run the code and a window appears with the game "Pong" for 2 players.

player 1: arrows "up" and "down" move the paddle
player 2: "w" (up) and "s" (down) move the paddle

By moving the paddle up and down you try to hit the ball before it touches the wall. A player gets a point once the opponent misses a ball. 
The goal of the game is to defeat your opponent by reaching a higher score.
