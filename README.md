PONG GAME:
consists of 2 files: main.py and classes.py
The classes of classes.py are imported into the main.py


How it works:

Pong is a "tennis like" game that features two paddles and a ball. 
Run the code of main.py and a window appears with the game "Pong" for 2 players.

player 1: arrows "up" and "down" move the paddle
player 2: "w" (up) and "s" (down) move the paddle

By moving the paddle up and down you try to hit the ball before it touches the wall. A player gets a point once the opponent misses a ball. 
The goal of the game is to defeat your opponent by reaching a higher score. 



SNAKE GAME:
consists of 2 files: snake_main.py, snake_class.py, data.txt
The classes are imported in the main file. The text file is used to save the highest score.


How it works: 

Run the code of snake_main.py and a window appears with the game "snake" for 1 player.
The player navigates with the 4 arrow buttons: up, down, right, left

The game involves controlling a snakehead by turning in 4 possible directions by ninety degrees until you manage to eat the blue turtle. 
When you get the turtle, you get 1 point, the snake grows an extra body segment and a new blue turtle is visible on the screen. 
If, or rather when, the snake bumps into the edge of the screen or accidentally eats itself the game is over and starts automatically again. 
At the scoreboard you can see your current score as well as the highest reached score so far.
